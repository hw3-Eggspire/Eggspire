# Eggspire

Have you ever forgot about those delicious bananas that regretfully went bad? How about accidentally drinking a mouthful of sour milk? Worry no more! Eggspire helps you keep track of your refrigerator inventory and reminds you about expiration dates. Save money by eating foods before they expire. Save your taste buds and health by getting rid of already expired foods. 

When creating this app, we considered your convenience. After grocery shopping, simply take a picture of your receipt and all your items will be automatically added to the app. We will also send you periodic notifications and reminders about your inventory. 

Use Eggspire on the web or as a mobile app in synchronization by connecting with your Google account.
